# Problem 4 [20.0/20.0 points (graded)]
# author: @raj-ch017

"""

      In this problem, you will implement a class according to the specifications in the template file usresident.py.
      The file contains a Person class similar to what you have seen in lecture and a USResident class (a subclass of Person).
      Person is already implemented for you and you will have to implement two methods of USResident.

      For example, the following code:

          a = USResident('Tim Beaver', 'citizen')
          print(a.getStatus())
          b = USResident('Tim Horton', 'non-resident')
          will print out:

          citizen

#code:

class USResident(Person):
    """ 
    A Person who resides in the US.
    """
    def __init__(self, name, status):
        """ 
        Initializes a Person object. A USResident object inherits 
        from Person and has one additional attribute:
        status: a string, one of "citizen", "legal_resident", "illegal_resident"
        Raises a ValueError if status is not one of those 3 strings
        """
        super().__init__(name)
        if (status=="citizen" or status=="legal_resident" or status=="illegal_resident"):
            self.status=status
        else:
            raise ValueError

    def getStatus(self):
        """
        Returns the status
        """
        return self.status
