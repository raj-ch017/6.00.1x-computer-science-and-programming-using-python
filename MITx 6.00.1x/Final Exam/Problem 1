"""

      Write a Python function that takes in a string and prints out a version of this string that does not contain any vowels, 
      according to the specification below. Vowels are uppercase and lowercase 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.

      For example:
      
      if s = "This is great!" then print_without_vowels will print Ths s grt!. 
      If s = "a" then print_without_vowels will print the empty string .
      
      You will not be able to see the test cases for this question. This will test your ability to come up with your own test cases.
