"""
Is the Word Guessed

Please read the Hangman Introduction before starting this problem. 
We'll start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily code the Hangman problem. 

First, implement the function isWordGuessed that takes in two parameters - a string, secretWord, and a list of letters, lettersGuessed. 
This function returns a boolean - True if secretWord has been guessed (ie, all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed) and False otherwise.
"""

def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    '''
    secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: boolean, True if all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed;
      False otherwise
    '''
    # FILL IN YOUR CODE HERE...
    match = len(secretWord)
    count = 0
    for char in secretWord:
      if char in lettersGuessed:
        count += 1
    if count == match:
      return True 
    else:
     return False
