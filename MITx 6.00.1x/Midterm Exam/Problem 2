"""
Write a Python function that returns the sublist of strings in aList that contain fewer than 4 characters. 

For example, if aList = ["apple", "cat", "dog", "banana"], your function should return: ["cat", "dog"]

This function takes in a list of strings and returns a list of strings. Your function should not modify aList.

      def lessThan4(aList):
          '''
          aList: a list of strings
          '''

"""

def lessThan4(aList):
    out_list = []
    for item in aList:
        if len(item) < 4:
            out_list.append(item)
    return out_list
