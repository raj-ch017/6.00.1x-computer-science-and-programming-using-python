# Problem 4 - Hand Length [10.0/10.0 points (graded)]
# author: @raj-ch017

"""
      We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. 
      We'll be implementing the playHand function. 
      This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to implement the helper calculateHandlen function, 
      which can be done in under five lines of code.
