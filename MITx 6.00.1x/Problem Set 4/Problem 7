# Problem 7 - You and your Computer [20.0/20.0 points (graded)]

"""

      Now that your computer can choose a word, you need to give the computer the option to play. 
      Write the code that re-implements the playGame function. You will modify the function to behave as described below in the function's comments. 
      As before, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand. 
      Be sure to try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program.

def playGame(wordList):
    """
    Allow the user to play an arbitrary number of hands.
 
    1) Asks the user to input 'n' or 'r' or 'e'.
        * If the user inputs 'e', immediately exit the game.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'n', 'r', or 'e', keep asking them again.

    2) Asks the user to input a 'u' or a 'c'.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'c' or 'u', keep asking them again.

    3) Switch functionality based on the above choices:
        * If the user inputted 'n', play a new (random) hand.
        * Else, if the user inputted 'r', play the last hand again.
      
        * If the user inputted 'u', let the user play the game
          with the selected hand, using playHand.
        * If the user inputted 'c', let the computer play the 
          game with the selected hand, using compPlayHand.

    4) After the computer or user has played the hand, repeat from step 1
